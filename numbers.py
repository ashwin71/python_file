#Numbers can be integer float and complex numbers.
'''a = 5
b = 6.5
c = 5+4j
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))'''

#Type casting from one type to another.
'''d = 7
e = str(d)
print(type(e))'''

#There are many fn in python for numbers like absolute,power,etc
'''f = -2
g = abs(f)
print(g)'''

#Math module is used for fn in maths like sqrt,power,sin,cos,etc
'''import math

var1 = math.pow(2,3)
print(var1)'''

#Math operations:

#Addition subtraction multiplication division and modula use appropriate symbols like +-*/% respectively.
'''var2 = 5
var3 = 6
var1 = var2 + var3
print(var1)'''

#comparision operations:
# equal to (==), lessthan (<), Greater than(>),<=,>=

'''var1 = 5
var2 = 6
if (var2 == 6):
    print("hello")'''

#Logical operators:
'''And,or and Not'''
